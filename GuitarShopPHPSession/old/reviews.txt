The Alvarez guitar brand was born in 1965 as a result of a collaboration between the St Louis Music distributor in the US and master luthier Kazuo Yairi in Japan, whose aim was to import good quality acoustic guitars into the US. Cut to today and they’re a brand that is really making waves in the industry. Their use of quality tonewoods, attention to detail, high build standards and attractive price points are just some of the reasons many players are choosing Alvarez.

The Alvarez AD30 is a dreadnought acoustic guitar featuring a solid sitka spruce top and layered African mahogany back and sides. There are also some other key specs that help this guitar punch above its price tag, including a real bone nut, sturdy tuners and forward-shifted X-bracing. 

The 30 series represents incredible value for money, it being the entry point into guitars built with a solid top. However, the AD30 is more than just an entry-level guitar. Sure, it’s a great option for players just starting out, but more experienced guitarists will no doubt find it a really fun and expressive instrument to play.
